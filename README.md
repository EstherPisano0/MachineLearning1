Classification

Classification in machine learning is a predictive modeling process where models use classification algorithms to predict the correct label for input data based on learned class characteristics from training datasets.
During training, models understand the relationships between features and class labels, then apply those criteria to new data to make accurate predictions.
Classification is a supervised learning technique, meaning it uses labeled data to train models.
The model's performance is evaluated using test data to ensure it can make successful predictions with unseen real-world data.

In the context of machine learning (ML), classification is a type of supervised learning where the goal is to predict the category or class label of new observations based on past observations with known class labels.

Roles in an ML team are crucial for the successful execution of classification tasks and other ML projects. These roles include data analysts, data engineers, data scientists, research scientists, ML engineers, and developers.
